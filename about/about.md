# About this site

So, you've somehow found your way to my website, no doubt seeking enlightenment.

Man are you in for a disappointment!

But hey, since you're already here, why not check out some of my
[half-finished-projects]() or [rambling posts](posts)?
Who knows, maybe you can find something of interest.


# About Me

I'm a software developer by trade and by hobby, which means I spend a lot of
time mashing a keyboard and occasionally produce something vaguely resembling
usable software.

My current project is [Damage Control](https://github.com/rcorre/damage_control),
an homage to one of my favorite old games
[Rampart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_(video_game)).

This leverages my project [dtiled](https://github.com/rcorre/dtiled), which is a
general-purpose library for creating tile-mapped games in the D programming
language.

# Things I Like:

- [D](http://dlang.org/), a language that boasts compile-time metaprogramming
  that won't melt your brain, robust range-based functional programming, and
  whole host of other cool things.

- [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/), a tragically under-appreciated
  game programming library that 'just works' for the functionality I need and
  stays out of my way the rest of the time.

- [aseprite](http://www.aseprite.org/) for pixel art.

- [LMMS](http://www.aseprite.org/) to create music.

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to create vector graphics.

- [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) to tweak sound effects.

- [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) to build maps for my games.

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) for writing code.

- [Awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/), to make my desktop, well, awesome.

- [st](http://st.suckless.org/), what's a programmer without a good terminal?
